### Kaggle:
[Give Me Some Credit](https://github.com/Sally-Ng/Kaggle_Give_Me_Some_Credit/tree/master) </br>
Language: Python (scikit-learn, Matplotlib, pandas, NumPy) </br> 
Skills: Machine Learning, Data Exploration, Data Visualization </br>
Built Supervised Machine Learning models to predicting the probability that somebody will experience 
financial distress in the next two years. Received a score of 0.77 and the winner of the competition had a score of 0.87.

[Project 2: Finding Donors for Charity](https://github.com/Sally-Ng/Udacity-Finding_Donors_for_Charity) </br>
Language: Python (scikit-learn, pandas, NumPy) </br> 
Skills: Machine Learning, Data Exploration, Data Visualization </br>
Compared the accuracy of the SVM, Decision Tree and Naïve Bayes models on distinguishing potential donors. Optimized the model with GridSearchCV and preformed features selection to reduce training time.
